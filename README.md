# SynSearch

This was a group project at Clemson University where I ended up doing all of the implementation on my own. It allows one to search a word such as "slumber" and view the search resutls for all synonyms related to the term. I used a synonym parser found on the following website - 
http://thesaurus.altervista.org/testphp
After carefully inspecti
ng the code and seeing how it worked I created a database as well as a dummy site to display my database.  Next I created a direct word search for the database using simple PHP scripts.  After ensuring this worked error free, I proceeded to take bits of the synonym parser code and implement them into my search function. My search function worked with the synonym searcher and allowed me to search for terms such as automobile and display all results in my database with terms such as car. I then proceeded to make the page look more professionsal by adding some CSS style as well as html format. For more in depth information on how this works please feel free to read my technical report also located in this repo.  To view and play with a live demo please visit the site located at the bottom of this README.  The simplest way to try the search is to look at the entries on the home page and think of a synonym for any word you see. Simply type the word you are thinking in the top right corner search bar and you should see your intended result.
